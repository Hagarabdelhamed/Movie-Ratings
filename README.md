# IMDB Top 2000 Movies Clustering Project
- This project involves clustering the top 2000 movies from IMDB based on user ratings. We will use the k-means algorithm to group these movies into k clusters, where k is an input provided by the user. Additionally, the program will detect any outlier data.


## Dataset
- The dataset is in the file imdb_top_2000_movies.csv, which contains the ratings of the top 2000 movies between 1921 and 2010. Each row in the dataset represents a movie and its associated user ratings.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib (optional for visualization)
